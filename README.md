# Letters_game
Spanish game called "Letras" implemented with a tree.

The tree is implemented with template nodes, that means you are able to take the file "ArbolGeneral" and use it filling
the nodes with any other class with other purpose.
The game rules and the game working are explained on the doxygen documentation added. Watch "makefile" in order to build it.
